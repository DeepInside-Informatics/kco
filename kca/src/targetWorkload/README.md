# targetWorkload CRD
Provides specifications for standard Kubernetes Workloads, i.e., Deployments, Pods, Services, etc.

The `targetWorkloadOperator` is essentially a finite-state machine for all possible Events generated by the Target.

# How to test? (STILL NEEDS WORK)
- Deploy a `kind` instance.
- Make sure your `KUBECONFIG` context points to this new cluster
- Deploy the [`crd`](crd.yaml)
- Create a virtual environment for running the Operator:
  ```bash
  # cwd targetWorkload
  python -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  kopf run targetWorkloadOperator.py
  ```
